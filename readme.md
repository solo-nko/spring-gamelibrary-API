# Game Purchase Library

## What is it?

A barebones Java-based back-end data API built in Spring Data. It's meant to provide a way to record, access and search through games I've purchased, which is something I currently already do with a OneNote page.

## Why does it exist?

I wanted to practice using Spring and other back-end concepts. I would also like to try building a simple front-end because inputting data via curl-based JSON is a big pain, but I don't currently know how to do that.
